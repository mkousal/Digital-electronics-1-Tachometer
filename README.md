### Project objectives

Our application uses two hall sensors for measuring speed, traveled distance, burnt calories and time (not by the hall sensor). <br/>
This data is shown on four 7segment displays (one part).
  - Calories counting
  - Total time
  - Total distance traveled
  - Trip distance traveled
  - Speed measuring <br/>

Modes can be selected by pressing buttons (see below). <br/>
One hall sensor is used for measuring speed and traveled distance. Another one is for calories counting. <br/>
Burnt calories will increase only by stepping the pedals, not by downhill riding!

## VHDL modules description

### Buttons
#### `Button_int`:
   - This block reads the input from real world buttons and translates them to commands which will be sent to the state_machine controller. When buttons *up* or *down* are            pressed, the interface will enter a cooldown state when no additional button presses will be registered (to prevent jitter) after the cooldown passes, the interface will        send an *up* or *down* command out
   - If the *ok* button is pressed, the device enters the cooldown state, after which it will wait for a longer ammount of time. If no additional *ok* button press is                registered, the interface will send out an *startstop* command
   - If, however, the *ok* button would be pressed again, the interface will send out the *reset* command
### Traveled distance
#### `km_total`:
   - This block counts the travel distance and sends it out to the display. Every 100 m (meters) an pulse will appear on the `meters_i` which will add to the total count of up        to *999,9 km* 
   - When the **trip mode** is activated the block will count the trip time and send it to the display instead, the total time is being still counted in the background
   - *rst signal* will make the current displayed data reset to 0 
   - The enable signal will be present if the trip is not paused, on *pause* the trip data is not counted
   - This block automaticaly wipes previous trip data when the mode is turned on

This block also contains a **function** which converts the traveled distance from *binary integer* to *BCD code* to be displayed on the 4 digit 7 segment display.

### Main controling module
#### `state_machine`:
   - This is the main utility block of the device. It recives commands from the button interface and switches the outputs accordingly. Inputs `up_i` and `down_i` will cycle          through the 4 modes of the device and light up their status LED 
   - While in a mode the *data stream* from its block will be sent to be displayed on the segment display via the `data_o`, with added decimal point or double dot if needed 
   - While in a mode the *reset* and *ok* commands also aply for the selected block only. The *trip mode* is special, because it does not generate data on its own, when              activated, it will send a mode change command to all blocks which will now store and display data in an additional variable as well as keeping the total count going 
   - The status LED of trip will remain on as we cycle through the other modes until it is paused by the *startstop* button or turned off via the reset. At this point all trip        data will be reset from all blocks and the normal total data will be displayed

### Time mode
#### `total_time`:
   - This block acts as a stopwatch. When startstop is applied, it will *start* or *pause* the counting
   - *Reset* will reset the total time
   - When the *trip mode* is enabled, the stopwatch will automatically start counting the trip time and will reset before every trip is started 
 
 This block also contains a **function** which converts the total time from *binary integer* to *BCD code* to be displayed on the 4 digit 7 segment display.

### SENSOR <br/>
#### `sensor`:
   - This block is used to calculate actual speed and triggering pulse every 100 meters for counting travelled distance <br/>
   - Uses input from hall sensor mounted at the front wheel. Output one trigger signal every counted 100 meters and calculate actual real speed and set it to display output   

### 7 Segment Driver Module <br/>
   - This block consists of 4 smaller modules: 
      1. `CLOCK`
      2. `UP_DOWN_COUNTER`
      3. `DRIVER_4X7SEG`
      4. `DECODER_7SEG` <br/>
#### `CLOCK`:
   - Generates 100MHz clock
   - This periodic signal is used in module `UP_DOWN_COUNTER`, which reacts on rising edge of the signal <br/>
   - Originally uses 4ms for each segment
#### `UP_DOWN_COUNTER`:
   - According settings (g_CNT_WIDTH), counts as the edge of the clock signal rises <br/>
#### `DRIVER_4X7SEG`:
   - Main module, drives four 7segment displays. It is determinated by `CLOCK` and `UP_DOWN_COUNTER` <br/>
   - Process MUX uses above modules to set data_outputs to each 7segment display <br/>
   - Input is a 16bit unsigned (`b"xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx"`)
#### `DECODER_7SEG`:
   This module is used for displaying data on 7segment display. If have more displays, MUX has to be used <br/>
   Both, common cathode and common anode can be used as well

### Calories Mode
#### `calories`:
   - This block calculates burned calories by measuring the time between each pedals rotations 
   - Rotation is captured by hall probe attached to pedal
   - The 100 MHz clock is used for counting time. Every 0.5s a number is increased, which recalculates the calories formula 
   - When signal from hall probe is not generating for 2s, the number that was increasing is stopped. The amount of burned calories is sent to display
   
## Testbenches and simulations
#### `Button_int`:
   - Shows states of `button_int` block
   - In order to save time and make the inner working of this device more clear, all simulated data has been sped up  
   ![image](images/button_int_bench.png)

#### `km_total`:
   - Screenshot demos how the counting works
   - In order to save time and make the inner working of this device more clear, all simulated data has been sped up
   ![image](images/km_total_bench.png)
   
#### `state_machine`:
   - Screenshot below represents testbench of main unit
   - In order to save time and make the inner working of this device more clear, all simulated data has been sped up 
   ![image](images/state_machine_bench.png) 

#### `total_time`:
   - Fincionality of total time counting is shown by this signals
   - In order to save time and make the inner working of this device more clear, all simulated data has been sped up
   ![image](images/total_time_bench.png) 

#### `sensor`: <br/>
   - First waveform shows how the speed calculation works. Calculated speed is written to the `s_disp_o`, which is 16bit word and is here until the new value is calculated
   ![image](images/tb_sensor_speed.png)
   - Second waveform shows pulsing at the `s_trigger_o` every 50 sensor's tick, which is equal to the 100 meters in real distance
   ![image](images/tb_sensor_trigger.png)

#### `CLOCK`: <br/>
   - Generates 100 MHz clock signal
   ![image](images/tb_CLOCK.PNG)
   
#### `UP_DOWN_COUNTER`: <br/>
   - As internal values set, counts with edge of the clock
   - 0-31 states:
   ![image](images/tb_UP_DOWN_COUNTER_01.PNG)
   - 0-31 states:
   ![image](images/tb_UP_DOWN_COUNTER_02.PNG)
   - 0-4 states = This is used in our application
   - Four 7segment displays are controlled by this states
   ![image](images/tb_UP_DOWN_COUNTER_03.PNG)
   
#### `DRIVER_4X7SEG`:
   - These screenshots show how the multiplexer works
   - `s_data` is the main 16bit data input
   - `s_hex` is the 4bit data output, which is used in `DECODER_7SEG`. This module decodes the 4bit data value and diplays it on a specific 7segment display
   - `s_dig_o` shows which one of four displays is being used. `b"0001"` means display on very right side
   - `s_seg_o` represents common cathode bits
   ![image](images/tb_DRIVER_4x7SEG_01.PNG)
   ![image](images/tb_DRIVER_4x7SEG_02.PNG)   
   - This screenshot shows a real situation, when input data will be refreshed every one second (tachometer)
   - If data is not changed for a while, displays will use last data. This prevents from wrong/unwanted values
   ![image](images/tb_DRIVER_4x7SEG_03.PNG)
#### `DECODER_7SEG`:
   - Decodes 4bit signal to 7bit (7 segments (+ decimal dot and colon))
   ![image](images/tb_DECODER_7SEG.PNG)

#### `calories`:
   - The simulation is in ratio 1s = 10ms
   - In wave form is display calories counting in both modes and amount of burned calories is sending to display
   ![image](images/tb_calories.PNG)
