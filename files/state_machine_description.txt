State Machine

This is the main utility block of the device. It recives commands from the button interface
and switches the outputs accordingly. Inputs up_i and down_i will cycle through the 4 modes
of the device and light up their status LED. While in a mode the data stream from it's block
will be sent to be displayed on the segment display via the data_o, with added decimal point
or double dot if needed. While in a mode the reset and ok commands also aply for the selected 
block only. The trip mode is special, because ot does not generate data on it's own, when
activated it will send a mode change command to all block which will now store and display 
data in an additional variable as well as keeping the total count going. The status LED of 
trip will remain on as we cycle through the other modes until it is paused by the startstop
button or turned off via the reset. At this point all trip data will be reset from all blocks
and the normal total data will be displayed.

NOTE: In order to save time and make the inner working of this device more clear, all simulated
data has been significantly sped up.
