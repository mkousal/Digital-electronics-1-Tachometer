This block counts the travel distance and sends it out to the display. Every 100m an pulse
will appear on the meters_i which will add to the total count of up to 999,9 km. When the
trip mode is activated the block will count the trip time and send it to the display instead
the total time is being still counted in the background. rst signal will make the current
displayed data reset to 0. The enable signal will be present if the trip is not paused, on
pause the trip data is not counted. This block automaticaly wipes previous trip data when
the mode is turned on.
This block also contains a function which converts the traveled distance from binary integer
to BCD code to be displayed on the 4 digit 7 segment display.

NOTE: In order to save time and make the inner working of this device more clear, all simulated
data has been significantly sped up.
