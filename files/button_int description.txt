This block reads the input from real world buttons and translates them to commands which
will be sent to the state_machine controller. When buttons up or down are pressed the
interface will enter a cooldown state when no additional button presses will be registered 
(to prevent jitter) after the cooldown passes, the interface will send an up or down command
out. If the ok button is pressed the device enters the cooldown state, after which it will
wait for a longer ammount of time. If no additional ok button press is registered, the 
interface will send out an startstop command. If however the ok button would be pressed
again, the interface will send out the reset command.

NOTE: In order to save time and make the inner working of this device more clear, all simulated
data has been sped up.
