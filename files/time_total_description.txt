This block acts as a stopwatch. When startstop is applied, it will start or pause the counting.
Reset will reset the total time. When the trip mode is enabled the stopwatch will automatically
start counting the trip time and will reset before every trip is started. This block also 
contains a function which converts the total time from binary integer to BCD code to be
displayed on the 4 digit 7 segment display.

NOTE: In order to save time and make the inner working of this device more clear, all simulated
data has been significantly sped up.
